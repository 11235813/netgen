The package demoapp explains how to add one's onw program
on top of Netgen. This is, e.g., a good students exercise 
for a finite element class.



Have a look into

demoapp.tcl .... defining the GUI
demoapp.cpp .... implementing the functions
configure.ac ... configures the package
Makefile.am .... defines the file structure



if you've got the svn - version, run first

  autoreconf --install

this requires the packages 'automake' and 'libtool' installed.



compile with

  ./configure --with-netgen=/opt/netgen
  make

install with

  make install


Make sure that the directory /opt/netgen/lib is in your shared
library search path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...)

and start netgen. You should have a new menu-item "DemoApp"



And, how did Netgen find to demoapp ? 
There is the command "load libdemoapp.so demoapp"
at the end of /opt/netgen/bin/ng.tcl

If it does not work, comment in the following two lines to 
obtain a proper error-message.




You can uninstall with

  make uninstall
