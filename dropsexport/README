The package dropsexp exports a netgen-generated mesh into a 
drops-compatible format in file xyz, i.e. into a standard 
fluent(gambit) format and eventually writes out second order 
information into another file (ending with xyz.2nd).

This package is based on the demoapp-package of netgen and 
the fluent-ouput (part of netgen already).



Have a look into

dropsexp.tcl .... defining the GUI
dropsexp.cpp .... implementing the functions
configure.ac ... configures the package
Makefile.am .... defines the file structure



if you've got the svn - version, run first

  autoreconf --install

this requires the packages 'automake' and 'libtool' installed.



configure with

  ./configure --with-netgen=ABC --with-netgensrc=DEF --prefix=GHI

with 
  ABC: the directory where netgen is installed into 
       (s.t. include files can be found)
  DEF: the directory where netgen is installed from 
       (s.t. other include files can be found)
  GHI: the directory where netgen is installed into 
       or where you want the new files want to be copied in 
       (s.t. netgen can find and load the new lib)

compile with

  make

install with

  make install


Make sure that the directory GHI/lib is in your shared
library search path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...)

Make sure that in the file ABC/bin/ng.tcl the following line exists
(typically at the end of the file)
"
catch { source ${ngdir}/dropsexp.tcl }
"

and start netgen. You should have a new menu-item "DROPS-Export"


You can uninstall with

  make uninstall
